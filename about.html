                    Welcome to my zone of titter. I believe happiness is in our hand. So I started creating handmade things. </p><p>
You will find everything on this site handmade which means quality and attachment with the item. We gift to people we love, so, we buy something that convey our emotions toward them. Handmade gifts are the expressions of the emotions and your love and affection for the person.
</p>
                    <p>
When I create any handmade item, all my senses are directly involved in the creation to make sure that it is 100% made with a whole lot of love, care and consideration.  The gift or the card itself says "I love and care about you".Each of the things on this site is unique and one of akind as time, attention and love has been planted into their creation. There are no two handmade items that are same, which makes each one of them special. 
                        </p>
                    <p>
I believe every essence of gifting is to express your feeling. So, you will not find any written sentiments on any card, bookmarks or on any gift. I request you to don't hide your feelings from the people you care about, if you wait too long to tell them, you might miss your chance. If you have trouble saying it, take a card write your feeling, if you wish, I can even write it for you on your behalf. Let your loved ones know how much they are valued, cherished, loved and cared for. Smallest item has been done with love to make the moment cherished.</p><p>

                You will find everything on this site especially in bright colors. My inspiration to work with colors come from different color combinations I came across daily, some are loud, some are childlike, and some are sober while some are inspiring. The material I use ranges from local market to all over the world. 
The consciousness with which the thing is made is often more important than the thing itself.
